# new-solid-start/server_examples/nginx.conf
# Nginx 1.28 example configuration for:
# - SPA root: /var/www/drawfun
# - PHP API files under: /var/www/drawfun/api (multiple PHP files)
# - phpMyAdmin mapped to /pa -> /var/www/phpMyAdmin
#
# Goals:
# 1. Serve the SPA and have front-end client-side routing (index.html fallback)
# 2. Ensure all /api/* requests are handled by PHP (multiple PHP files supported)
# 3. Ensure /pa/* (phpMyAdmin) is served from its alias directory and PHP files under /pa are handled correctly
# 4. Prevent SPA fallback from intercepting /api and /pa (including requests without trailing slash)
#
# Notes:
# - Adjust `server_name` and `fastcgi_pass` (php-fpm socket or host:port) for your environment.
# - For production, enable HTTPS and set cookies `secure` => true in backend responses.
# - This configuration uses explicit regex locations for PHP under /api and /pa so SCRIPT_FILENAME
#   is constructed correctly (alias vs root differences).
#
# Nginx matching behavior summary (important):
# - Nginx first checks exact "=" locations, then prefix locations (longest), then tests regex locations.
# - If a prefix location is declared with ^~, regex locations are NOT tested for that request.
# - Therefore: Do NOT use ^~ on /api/ or /pa/ if you want regex PHP handlers for those paths to be considered.
